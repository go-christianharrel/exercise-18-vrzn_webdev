Our group **focused** on practicing fundamental concepts essential for creating dynamic and interactive websites. We explored key aspects such as **_HTML_** for structuring web content, **_CSS_** for designing and styling web pages, and **_JavaScript_** for implementing dynamic and responsive features. Through _collaborative efforts_, we gained hands-on experience in creating user-friendly interfaces, optimizing web pages for various devices, and enhancing overall user experience.
